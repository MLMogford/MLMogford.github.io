## OS and Software  

To make proper use of docker, I have installed the basics:  
OS:                     Ubuntu 22.04  
Text editors:           VS Code, Obsidian  
Continer management:    Docker  
Sanity management:      Kigo  

Now I can use the template repos in my GitHub account to initialise a project and maintain a stable deployment when the development work is complete.
