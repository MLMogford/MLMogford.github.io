Michael Mogford is a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist working in Adelaide, South Australia.

I work in a team to develop machine learning services within a variety of domains. I focus on designing the cloud architecture, assisting with machine learning model design, and implementing pipelines that bring these ideas to reality.

I have a broad range of education and work experience, from biomedical science and conducting a pilot clinical drug trial, to computer science and conducting research into medical image classification using multimodal fusion and optimising sensitivity at a set specificity with a ranking loss function I developed.

I deeply value the experiences I have had travelling and living around the world. I have lived in Scotland, China and Nepal, and travelled through Europe, Asia and North America over 7 years. One highlyght was the opportunty to study at Peking University as a language student, and Tsinghua University to study my master's in computer science.
