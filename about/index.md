Michael Mogford is a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist working in Adelaide, South Australia.

I work in a team to develop machine learning services within a variety of domains. I focus on designing the cloud architecture, assisting with machine learning model design, and implementing pipelines that bring these ideas to reality.  

My broad range of education and work experience includes biomedical science and conducting a pilot clinical drug trial, to computer science and conducting research into medical image classification using multimodal fusion and optimising sensitivity at a set specificity with a ranking loss function I developed.   

This professional experience is complemented by a strong sense of community service and a deep interest in experiencing other cultures. My travels have taken me to Europe, Asia and North America; and I have lived in Scotland, China and Nepal. One highlight was the opportunty to study at Peking University as a language student, and Tsinghua University to study my master's in computer science.
