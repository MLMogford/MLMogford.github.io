Michael Mogford is a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist working in Adelaide, South Australia.  AWS 2x certified (Machine Learning - Specialty, Solutions Architect - Associate)

&nbsp;  

I work to develop machine learning services within a variety of domains. I focus on designing the cloud architecture, assisting with machine learning model design, and implementing pipelines that bring these ideas to reality.  

&nbsp;  

My broad range of education and work experience includes biomedical science and conducting a pilot clinical drug trial, to computer science and conducting research into medical image classification using multimodal fusion and optimising sensitivity at a set specificity with a ranking loss function I developed.  

&nbsp;  

This professional experience is complemented by a strong sense of community service and a deep interest in experiencing other cultures. My travels have taken me to Europe, Asia and North America; and I have lived in Scotland, China and Nepal. One highlight was the opportunty to study at Peking University as a language student, and Tsinghua University to study my master's in computer science.
